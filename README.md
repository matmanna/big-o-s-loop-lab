# Big O's Loop Lab

üîÅ A mini visual programming language game that teaches computational thinking through concepts such as algorithmic efficiency, optimization, and recursion. Although aimed at non-technical player, the game (with additional levels) will create interesting and novel puzzles which can challenge someone of any proficiency.

## Inspiration

When I first heard Mark announce the theme, I thought "I've got to be able to do something with electrical currents". But it turns out my original 3D prototype/plans were far too ambitious, so I ended up with a more achievable game about programming. While two-dimensional, the UI and code-evaluator implementations were anything but simple. Although I first considered Scratch-like blocks, I eventually decided on wires & nodes due to aesthetic preference. 

## Features

- Nodes
  - Loops
    - Repeat N
    - While
  - Math
    - Arithmetic
    - Booleans
  - Conditionals
    - If... then:
  - Data
    - Value 
    - Console Log
  - Motion & Sensing
    - Face []
    - Walk [] 
    - Facing wall?
    - Facing Goal? 
- Interface
  - Zoom-able, pan-able canvas
  - Categorized node palette
  - Limited wire-management
- Level management
  - Level select
  - Runnable/stoppable programs
  - Level status evaluation (sorta)

## Status/Roadmap

The game is fairly unfinished and contains many known bugs and undoubtedly many unknown ones. It would help a lot if you left a rating and commented any bugs/suggestions you might have!

In the next few of weeks, I will begin developing a post-jam version of the game taking into account suggestions and bugs discovered during the judging period and features I didn't have time to implement. To be notified for either of these things, follow me on itch.io. 

## Credits

Almost all of the art and code featured in the game was developed by me in Aseprite, Godot Game Engine, and FL Studio. 

Other code and assets were created by:
- Kenney (UI, game viewport assets)
- Nathan Hoad (Godot Dialogue Manager)
- Marek Belski (Godot Game Template)
