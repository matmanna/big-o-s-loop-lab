üîÅ A mini visual programming language game that teaches computational thinking through concepts such as algorithmic efficiency, optimization, and recursion. Although aimed at non-technical player, the game (with additional levels) will create interesting and novel puzzles which can challenge someone of any proficiency.

## ü§î  Inspiration

When I first heard Mark announce the theme, I thought "I've got to be able to do something with electrical currents". But it turns out my original 3D prototype/plans were far too ambitious, so I ended up with a more achievable game about programming. While two-dimensional, the UI and code-evaluator implementations were anything but simple. Although I first considered Scratch-like blocks, I eventually decided on wires & nodes due to aesthetic preference. 

## ‚ú® Features

- Nodes
  - Loops
	- Repeat N
	- While
  - Math
	- Arithmetic
	- Booleans
  - Conditionals
	- If... then:
  - Data
	- Value 
	- Console Log
  - Motion & Sensing
	- Face []
	- Walk [] 
	- Facing wall?
	- Facing goal? 
- Interface
  - Zoom-able, pan-able canvas
  - Categorized node palette
- Level management
  - Level select
  - Runnable/stoppable programs

## üó∫ Status/Roadmap

The game is fairly unfinished and contains many known bugs and undoubtedly many unknown ones. It would help a lot if you left a rating and commented any bugs/suggestions you might have!

In the next few of weeks, I will begin developing a post-jam version of the game taking into account suggestions and bugs discovered during the judging period and features I didn't have time to implement. To be notified for either of these things, follow me on itch.io.
